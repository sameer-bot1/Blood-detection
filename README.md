3.7	Random Forest :
Random Forest is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. However,
 it is mainly used for classification problems. As we know, a forest is made up of trees,
and the more trees there are, the stronger the forest is. Similarly, random forest algorithms build decision trees over data samples,
 get predictions from each, and finally choose the best solution by voting.
 
This is an ensemble method, which is better than a single decision tree because it reduces overfitting by averaging the results.[8]


The following diagram will illustrate its working –

**	**RESULT CBC REPORT********

•	**Anemia** -Low levels of healthy red blood cells hemoglobin and hematocrit.     Anemia causes fatigue , weakness, and has many causes, including low levels of certain vitamins and iron , blood loss, and underlying medical conditions.
                                  A low red blood cell count may be caused by:


•	Anemia due to prolonged bleeding or blood loss (hemorrhage), a diet lacking iron or certain vitamins, certain types of chemotherapy, blood disorders or chronic disease Lymphomas
 
●	- Cancers of the blood

●	- Bone marrow disorders

●	- Nutritional deficiency

●	- Chronic Kidney disease

●	- Chronic inflammatory disease




●	**Leukopenia** - Low white blood cell count. caused by conditions such as B. An autoimmune disease that destroys white blood cells, bone marrow problems, or cancer. Some drugs can also reduce the white. blood cell count
                    A low white blood cell count can be caused by:


●	- Viral infection

●	- Severe bacterial infection

●	- Bone marrow disorders

●	- Autoimmune conditions

●	- Lymphoma

●	- Dietary deficiencies 


●	**Leukocytosis** – Increased white blood cells. It may be due to infection, inflammation, or a reaction to medication.
                        A high white blood cell count may be caused by:


●	- Infection

●	- Leukemia

●	- Inflammation

●	- Stress, allergies, asthma


●	**Thrombocytopenia** – Low platelet count. Often a sign of underlying disorder or side effects of medication
●	A low platelet count may be due to:- Cancer, such as leukemia or lymphoma

●	- Autoimmune diseases

●	- Bacterial infection

●	- Viral infection like dengue

●	- Chemotherapy or radiation therapy
●	- Certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)


●	**Thrombocytosis** – Increased platelet count. Often a sign of an underlying disorder or side effects of medication:
●	- A high platelet count may be due to:- Bone marrow disorders
●	- Essential thrombocythemia
●	- Anemia
●	- Infection
●	- Surgical removal of the spleen
●	- Polycythemia vera
●	- Some types of leukemia[15]

●	**Polycythemia** – High red blood  cell count. A high RBC count can be caused by:

●	- Dehydration, such as from severe diarrhea

●	- tumours

●	- Lung diseases

●	- Smoking

●	- Polycythemia vera 



●	**Neutropenia** – A low neutrophil count, known as neutropenia, can be caused by:

●	- Severe infection

●	- Immunodeficiency

●	- Autoimmune disorders

●	- Dietary deficiencies

●	- Reaction to drugs

●	- Bone marrow damage 


●	**Neutrophilia** – An increased number of neutrophils, known as neutrophilia, can be caused by:

●	- Acute bacterial infections

●	- Inflammation

●	- Stress, Trauma

●	- Certain leukemias 


●	**Lymphocytopenia** – A low lymphocyte count, known as lymphopenia, can be caused by:

●	- Autoimmune disorders

●	- Infections

●	- Bone marrow damage

●	- Corticosteroids

 
●	**Lymphocytosis** – An increased number of lymphocytes, known as lymphocytosis, can occur due to:

●	- Acute viral infections

●	- Certain bacterial infections

●	- Chronic inflammatory disorder

●	- Lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma

●	- Acute stress 


●	**High Monocyte** – Increased monocyte count can occur due to:

●	- Chronic infections

●	- Infection within the heart

●	- Collagen vascular diseases

●	- Monocytic or myelomonocytic leukemia


●	**High Eosinophil** – Possible causes of high eosinophil count include:


●	- Asthma, allergies such as hay fever

●	- Drug reactions

●	- Parasitic infections

●	- Inflammatory disorders

●	- Some cancers, leukemias or lymphomas


●	**High Basophil** – Possible causes of high basophil count include: rare allergic reactions

○	- Inflammation

○	- Some leukemias

○	- Uremia
